/*
  Generic single-axis PID controller with anti-windup.

  The controller is unit-agnostic: feedback and setpoint can be in any
  physical units. The output is in whatever units the gains map to.

  Derivative is computed on the measurement, not the error, to avoid
  derivative kick when the setpoint changes abruptly — important in
  cascaded setups where the outer loop's output (= inner setpoint)
  can step from tick to tick.

  Anti-windup uses conditional integration: when the output saturates,
  the integral is frozen in the direction that would worsen
  saturation. Updates that would reduce saturation are still allowed,
  so the controller can climb back out once the error reverses.

  Caller passes dt explicitly. The controller does not track time; this
  keeps it usable at any loop rate (e.g. a cascade with a fast inner
  loop and a slow outer loop) without baking timing assumptions in.
